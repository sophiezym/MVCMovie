Movie listing webapp
A simple movie-listing application that supports creating, editing, searching and listing movies from a database.

The application also lets you add, edit, and delete movies, as well as see details about individual ones. All data-entry scenarios include validation to ensure that the data stored in the database is correct.


**How do I experience the functions?**
A user can experience by appending Movies after localhost:xxxx. (e.g. localhost:0000/Movies) to add movies, edit information of movies and delete a movie.

Currently, I am adding a search functionality to the webpage. Run the application and navidate to /Movies/SearchIndex.
Append a query string such as ?searchString=KEYWORDS to the URL. The filtered movies are displayed.
